# my-website
My first hand-coded website.

Hi,
My name is Emmanuel. I'm presently at the initial phase of my software engineering journey.
The repo contains my first "proper" attempt at hand-coding a website.

For now, I'm developing the website with html and css.

I hope to include JavaScript as I progress.
